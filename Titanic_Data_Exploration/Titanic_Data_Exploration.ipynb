    "In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. I will explore the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To complete this project, I will need to implement several conditional predictions and answer the questions below."

    "After several iterations of exploring and conditioning on the data, I have built a useful algorithm for predicting the survival of each passenger aboard the RMS Titanic. The technique applied in this project is a manual implementation of a simple machine learning model, the decision tree. A decision tree splits a set of data into smaller and smaller groups (called nodes), by one feature at a time. Each time a subset of the data is split, our predictions become more accurate if each of the resulting subgroups are more homogeneous (contain similar labels) than before. The advantage of having a computer do things for us is that it will be more exhaustive and more precise than our manual exploration above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is just one of many models that come from supervised learning. In supervised learning, we attempt to use features of the data to predict or model things with objective outcome labels. That is to say, each of our data points has a known outcome value, such as a categorical, discrete label like 'Survived', or a numerical, continuous value like predicting the price of a house."
